# Connect

A contacts-based reminder app for Android built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Connect helps you stay in touch with your contacts by scheduling reminders to reach out via call, message, or email.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Contact Management**: Pick contacts from your device or add custom contacts manually
- **Scheduled Reminders**: Set up reminders with customizable frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, or custom days)
- **Multiple Contact Methods**: Support for phone calls, SMS messages, and email
- **Smart Notifications**: View connections due today and all scheduled connections in separate tabs
- **Quick Actions**: Mark as contacted, call, message, or email directly from the connection list

### Visual Features
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded contacts based on last contact time:
  - 🟢 Green: Contacted within your reminder frequency (not overdue)
  - 🟡 Yellow: Overdue by up to one reminder period
  - 🔴 Red: Overdue by more than one reminder period or never contacted
- **Profile Pictures**: Display contact photos from your device contacts (with placeholder for contacts without photos)
- **Relative Time Display**: See when you last contacted someone in human-readable format (e.g., "2 days ago", "3 weeks ago")
- **Action Icons**: Call, message, and email icons aligned with their respective contact information rows
- **Animated Interactions**: Smooth animations for checkmark completion and navigation bar transitions
- **Phone Number Formatting**: Automatic formatting with dashes (XXX-XXX-XXXX) for better readability

### Additional Features
- **Birthday Tracking**: Display birthdays on connection cards with optional prompt on birthday
- **Connection Details**: View full connection details, edit, or delete connections
- **Contact Integration**: Deep link to view imported contacts in phone's Contacts app, or add custom connections to Contacts
- **Input Validation**: Phone number and email validation with error messages
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Refresh connection lists by pulling down on Today or All tabs
- **About Screen**: Built-in help and explanation of the app's purpose
- **Splash Screen**: Beautiful welcome screen on app launch
- **Scrollable Forms**: Easy-to-use scrollable add/edit screens with toolbar save button

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt
- **Database**: Room Persistence Library
- **Navigation**: Navigation Compose
- **Coroutines & Flow**: For asynchronous operations

## Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

- **Data Layer**: Room entities, DAOs, repositories, and mappers
- **Domain Layer**: Business models and logic
- **UI Layer**: Compose screens, ViewModels, and navigation

## Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:
- `READ_CONTACTS`: To access your device contacts and import contact information
- `CALL_PHONE`: To make calls directly from the app
- `SEND_SMS`: To send messages directly from the app (optional - messages can be sent via system apps without this permission)
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`: To show reminder notifications (Android 13+)
- `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`: To schedule exact alarm notifications
- `USE_EXACT_ALARM`: To use exact alarm scheduling
